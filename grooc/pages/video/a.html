                            <p>
                              Do you want to make a difference by collaborating with other like-minded individuals from around the globe? Maybe you’re already working with a group doing social impact work in an established organization/NGO. Or perhaps you have an idea for a social initiative and want to team up with others, locally or virtually. Or maybe you’re just concerned about the direction the world is heading and want to join a global conversation about creating some positive, sustainable change. If so, this first ever GROOC is for you.   
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Our GROOC has a distinct pedagogy: we believe profound learning happens when people share their experiences with each other, ask questions and tell stories. It’s called social learning. There are no right or wrong answers and no tests along the way. Instead, you’ll delve into relevant issues that concern all social initiatives, at any stage of development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Over seven sessions, you will be exposed to concepts and models from our four course designers and will hear from top international scholars and practitioners who combine the best thinking with the most effective doing. Plus, you’ll have access to more than 20 “deep dive” interviews with fascinating individuals who are at the forefront of creating social change, including Muhammad Yunus, Mary Gordon, Marshall Ganz, and many more.
