                    cultural, creative and technology to the city.</p>

                    I want to allow the talent and creativity of the citizens of Bergamo to find the best conditions in order to realize their ideas, project proposals and aspirations.
                    But above all, spaces for meaningful encounters, exchange and inspiration, full of different people will do amazing things together. Bergamo HUB will be part of an international network of beautiful physical spaces where entrepreneurs, 
                    and creative professionals will have access to all the resources, let inspired by the work of others, have innovative ideas, develop useful relationships and individual tify new market opportunities and development.
                    It will be a space dedicated citizen innovation and social entrepreneurship and the people who promote. here you can meet people very different, contractors and operators non-profit organizations, 
                    professionals, young people, students, educators, designers and experts in different sectors, all united by the desire to improve and enhance the lives of community sharing ideas and challenges of the future.</p>
